For exa mple, given a dataset, where \\nfive percent and ninety -five percent are minority class samples and majority class samples, respectively. If a classifier \\nrecognizes all data as the majority class, the classification accuracy would be ninety -five percent. Howe ver, this \\nclassifier is not useful in practice.  For many real -world problems, the class of interest is the minority class. How to \\naccurately identify the minority class sample is a more challenging problem. The problem has drawn significant \\ninterest since the year 2000 from data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning and artificial intelligence. \\nImbalanced learning has become an especially hot topic under some special issues (Yu et al. 2013), conference and'),\n",
       " Document(page_content='bioinformatics area can choose an effective technique  once the distribution of the data is known in advance. To the \\nbest of our knowledge, no previous comprehensive empirical investigations have been performed in comparing the \\nperformance of imbalanced data learning methods  with data distribution being consi dered.  \\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the techniques to be evaluated in this study , while \\nthe details of datasets are presented in S ection III. The experimental design, performance metrics and classification \\nalgorithms are outlined in Section IV. Section V di scusses the experimental result . The c onclusion is  provided in \\nSection VI . 2 Methods to B e Evaluated  \\nGenerally speaking, approach es to classification with imbalanced data issues involve three main categories: \\nresampling, cost -sensitive methods and the ensemble methods (He and Garcia 2009) , (Yang et al. 2014), (Lin et al.')]"
